### Start of the Game
To begin the player sees a big Door with three locks. This should already show that the player needs to look for those Keys.

### Hub
The hub is a central location from which all the riddles are accessible. After the player enters it for the first time he can not leave it again.

### Staircase Riddle
This Riddle is accessible when the Player goes left after entering the Hub. In this one the Teleporters will let the Player think he is caught in an infinite Staircase.

### Forkways Riddle
This Riddle is accessible when the Player goes right after entering the Hub. Here the player will need to go through a specific sequence of corridors to escape.

### Falling Blocks Riddle
This Riddle is accessible when the Player goes straight after entering the Hub. Here the player first enters a big room filled with skeletons before going into another, this time empty, room of the same shape.
The second room's floor is entirely made from 2x2 tiles of which only one path won't fall down when the player steps on them.

### End of the Game
When the player finishes the third riddle instead of returning to the Hub he will enter this last room which congratulates him for finishing the game and shows all three keys in the locks of the door.
